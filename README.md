## Optical Flow Hallucinations for Pitt's AD dataset
Im2Flow's implementation for flow hallucination was used to generate these predictions. Their implementation and project page can be found here: [[Github Repo]](https://github.com/rhgao/Im2Flow)    [[Project Page]](http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/im2flow/)
### Generating Flow Visualizations
### Observations
Due to diversity of the dataset, the performance of the model on our dataset seemed to have high variance. The following are patterns I noticed from flow hallucinations generated from a random subset of Pitt's ad dataset. These appear to be biases created from the training dataset (HMDB-51). <br/>
